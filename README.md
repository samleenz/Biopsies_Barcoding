## generate barcode counts

To generate a barcode count matrix from a barcode-seq file using the edgeR processAmplicon function. 

> Note, fastq files must be uncompressed for this function.

```R
library(edgeR)

counts <-  processAmplicons(
  readfile = "path/to/read_R1.fastq",
  readfile2 = "path/to/read_R2.fastq",
  barcodefile = "index_tables/{run}_TrueIndexes.txt", # tsv of sample specific barcodes
  hairpinfile = "LongBarcodes.txt", # barcode sequences
  verbose = TRUE
)
```
